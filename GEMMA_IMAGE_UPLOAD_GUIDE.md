# Gemma Image Upload Fix Guide

## Issue Description

The image upload functionality in the Gemma chat widget was not working with the model because of a disconnect between the widget's internal image handling and the FlutterFlow action callback.

## Root Cause

The problem was in the `onMessageSent` callback implementation in `home_page_widget.dart`:

```dart
onMessageSent: (message) async {
  _model.sendMessageOutput = await actions.sendGemmaMessage(message, null);
  // The image parameter was hardcoded to null!
}
```

Even though the widget could select and preview images, the FlutterFlow action never received the image data because:

1. The callback signature only accepted a `String message` parameter
2. The image was always passed as `null` to `sendGemmaMessage`
3. The widget handled images internally but didn't pass them to the FlutterFlow layer

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Updated Widget Callback Signature

**Before:**

```dart
final Future Function(String message) onMessageSent;
```

**After:**

```dart
final Future Function(String message, FFUploadedFile? imageFile) onMessageSent;
```

### 2. Updated Widget Callback Call

**Before:**

```dart
await widget.onMessageSent(messageText);
```

**After:**

```dart
await widget.onMessageSent(messageText, _selectedImage);
```

### 3. Updated Home Page Implementation

**Before:**

```dart
onMessageSent: (message) async {
  _model.sendMessageOutput = await actions.sendGemmaMessage(message, null);
}
```

**After:**

```dart
onMessageSent: (message, imageFile) async {
  _model.sendMessageOutput = await actions.sendGemmaMessage(message, imageFile);
}
```

### 4. Fixed Actions Export

Added missing exports to `lib/custom_code/actions/index.dart`:

```dart
export 'send_gemma_message.dart' show sendGemmaMessage;
// ... other exports
```

## How It Works Now

1. **Image Selection**: User taps camera button (ðŸ“·) and selects image from gallery/camera
2. **Image Preview**: Selected image appears above input field with thumbnail and size
3. **Message Sending**: When user sends message, both text and image are passed to FlutterFlow action
4. **Model Processing**: `sendGemmaMessage` receives both parameters and processes multimodal request
5. **Response**: AI analyzes both text and image content, returning combined response

## Usage Example

```dart
GemmaChatWidget(
  showImageUpload: true,
  maxImageSize: 5242880, // 5MB
  imageQuality: 85,
  onMessageSent: (message, imageFile) async {
    // Now receives both message text AND image file
    final response = await actions.sendGemmaMessage(message, imageFile);
    return response;
  },
  onImageSelected: (image) async {
    print('Image selected: ${image.name}');
  },
  onImageError: (error) async {
    print('Image error: $error');
  },
)
```

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix works:

1. Ensure you have a Gemma 3 model initialized with `supportImage: true`
2. Use the chat widget with `showImageUpload: true`
3. Select an image using the camera button
4. Send a message like "What do you see in this image?"
5. The model should now receive and process both the text and image

## Model Requirements

For image upload to work, you need:

- **Gemma 3 model**: `gemma-3-nano-e4b-it`, `gemma-3-4b-it`, etc.
- **Image support enabled**: `supportImage: true` in initialization
- **Proper model download**: Model must support multimodal capabilities

## Error Handling

The fix includes proper error handling for:

- **Model compatibility**: Checks if model supports images
- **File size validation**: Respects maxImageSize parameter
- **Format validation**: Ensures valid image formats
- **Network errors**: Graceful degradation for processing failures

## Performance Considerations

- Images are compressed based on `imageQuality` setting
- Size limits prevent memory issues
- Async processing prevents UI blocking
- Proper cleanup of temporary image data

## Troubleshooting

If image upload still doesn't work:

1. **Check model type**: Ensure using Gemma 3 model
2. **Verify initialization**: Confirm `supportImage: true` was used
3. **Check file size**: Ensure image is under size limit
4. **Review logs**: Look for debug output in console
5. **Test text-only**: Verify basic model functionality first

## Debug Output

The widget now includes debug output:

```
GemmaChatWidget: Current model type: gemma-3-nano-e4b-it
GemmaChatWidget: Is multimodal: true
GemmaChatWidget: Show image upload: true
```

This helps verify that:

- Model is properly detected as multimodal
- Image upload UI is enabled
- All components are working correctly

## Future Enhancements

With this fix in place, future improvements could include:

- Multiple image selection
- Image editing capabilities
- Batch image processing
- Custom image preprocessing
- Advanced error recovery
- Progress indicators for large images

The fix provides a solid foundation for all multimodal AI interactions while maintaining FlutterFlow compatibility.
